# CapsNet
Capsule Net Implementation / Tensorflow 1.4

## Capsule Network (Tensorflow)
Capsule Network implementation in Tensorflow based on Geoffrey Hinton's paper [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829). 

## This code
This code is partly modified from Aurelien Geron's Caps Net(https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/extra_capsnets.ipynb). Modified : Digit Caps routing part as loop. 

### Materials
Other materials for learning CapsNet,
1. Aurelien Geron's explanation on [Capsule Networks â€“ Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPN8d0E3900&t=297s) and [How to implement CapsNets using TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kawrd5szHE) were great. 
2. Also inspired by XifengGuo's implementation on [CapsNet-Keras](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras).
